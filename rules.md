###Accomplices

You are permitted to use unarmed accomplices in your elimination attempts. You are encouraged to have witnesses—they help resolve disagreements, but more importantly, add entertainment.

###Disputes and Ceasefires

The gamemaster is at complete liberty to call a ceasefire and determine the outcome of an elimination attempt in the event of any disputes. The result of such negotiations are at the gamemaster's discretion, and their word is final.

###Suicide

Suicide is not permitted. If you would like to be removed from the game, contact the gamemaster and they will make proper arrangements.

###Time Out

In the event of an emergency or suspected breaking of the rules, a player can call “Time Out”, immediately marking the surrounding area OOB. Abuse of this privilege will result in disqualification.

###Out of Bounds

Many off-campus locations are in-game, and elimination attempts can be made both in and out of school. However, in the spirit of sanity and respect for others, certain areas are regarded as Out of Bounds (OOB) and are not legal for fair play. If in doubt, consider whether any elimination attempts in the area would be dangerous or disrespectful. Some OOB areas:

Any classroom, regardless of whether or not class is in session.
Theaters, offices, and libraries.
Public buildings of all kinds, including religious buildings.
Anyone under employ is OOB while at work.
Dances (and the lines to go in) are considered off limits. The areas surrounding, however, are fair game.
Lunch lines are in bounds for non-projectile weapons.
Organized sports activities are OOB. Pick up games are in bounds.
Any participant operating a vehicle is OOB. Passengers are in bounds, unless attacking said party may pose risk to the vehicle’s occupants.
Public transportation is OOB.
Class hours are out of bounds, unless both you and your target have preps.
Hallways during passing period are in bounds.
Escape

###Reporting Kills

You must report kills within 24 hours of the act.
You must report kills in order.
You must provide proof to the gamemaster. Generally this is provided through video, but if the gamemaster watches the kill take place, that is also sufficient proof.

###Receiving Targets

At the beginning of the game, your target is emailed to the email you provided during registration.
At any point in the game you may ask the gamemaster, either by email or in person, who your current target is.
When you report kill, the gamemaster will tell you who your target is.

OOB regions may not be use to escape elimination unless the attacked party has prior obligations at that area.

###Tools

All tools must be clearly labeled with what they are. The following tools are allowed:

Tableware: Spoons, forks, and sporks can be used to eliminate your target. Contact with your target qualifies as elimination.

If you have an elaborate plan to get a kill (like having a box hang from the rafters and fall on the target), run the idea by the gamemaster. If it is reasonably safe, it will be approved and you can kill your target.

If you have ideas for a novel type of weapon, run them by the gamemaster. Most of the time, as long as they aren't potentially harmful and not overpowered, it'll be a yes.



Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

###What really is this?

ESHS Assassins' Guild is a school-wide game where students use spoons and other tools to eliminate other players. It's intended as a fun, social opportunity for community-level competition. Games generally last about a week.

###Who's behind this?

The idea stemmed from the Cambridge Assassins' Guild. The ESHS Faction is run by Benjamin Landers.

###What does it take to play?

The game is free of cost, but takes some time and dedication. Some competitors will be more devoted than others, but it doesn't take much more than sportsmanship and a will to have fun to play. You can forget about the game for days at a time if desired, but just remember that letting your guard down leaves you open to attack.

###How do you eliminate players?

Specifics are provided in the rules, but it’s primarily through the use of labeled tools. Some of the more common ones are sporks (and spoons), but creativity allows anything from ‘poisoned’ doorknobs to ‘refrigerator’ cardboard boxes thrown from rooftops. Discretion is left up to the gamemaster as to what’s permitted and what isn’t.

###What happens when you eliminate someone?

After the euphoria of a well-executed elimination wears off, both you and your victim inform the gamemaster, and the victim’s target is now assigned to you. In the event of a dispute, all related parties will be brought for discussion with the gamemaster.

###What happens when you're eliminated?

Depending on how glorious your elimination, you may go on to be sung of in legend for coming years. Regardless, this usually involves sending an account of your elimination to the gamemaster and informing your assassin of their next target (your target before elimination). Depending on the gamemaster, you may be permitted to assist in other elimination attempts.
